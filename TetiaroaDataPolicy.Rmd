# Tetiaroa IDEA Data Policy

Tetiaroa Society, French Polynesia

\

# Preamble

The owners of Tetiaroa have entrusted **Tetiaroa Society (TS)** as the private atoll's environmental steward with authority to develop and implement the **Tetiaroa Conservation & Sustainable Use Plan (CASUP)**. Tetiaroa Society manages access to the atoll for research, education, and conservation, or any other purposes not directly linked to The Brando Resort. All projects are authorized by Tetiaroa Society after review of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Cultural Advisory Board (CAB), and/or CASUP Committee, as appropriate. The handling of **research data** and other research outputs, including material samples and intellectual property, is a key consideration for Tetiaroa Society and the current document sets out its policy in this regard. Tetiaroa Society has responsibility for governance of the **Tetiaroa Data Trust** (defined herein) and participates in two global programs that provide a framework for its research data policy and procedures:

\

### Tetiaroa IDEA

Tetiaroa Society is a collaborating node of the **Island Digital Ecosystem Avatars (IDEA) Consortium** that aims to build use-oriented 4-D simulations (digital avatars or twins) of entire social-ecological systems. A~~n~~  social-ecological avatar is the digital representation of the data and knowledge about a place, enabling actions (e.g., conservation management) to be assessed in silico prior to deploying them in the real world. **Tetiaroa IDEA** is coordinated by Tetiaroa Society to facilitate scenario-based planning and to serve as a decision-support tool for the Tetiaroa CASUP. 

\

### FAIR Island Project 

The stewardship of research data and samples underpins scientific reproducibility, synthesis, and reuse. Embedded in a broad international research network, Tetiaroa is the key use case for the FAIR Island Project ([www.fairisland.org](http://www.fairisland.org)), which aims to demonstrate the benefits of global best-practice in data stewardship. Drawing on the 'FAIR' data principles and the CARE principles for Indigenous data governance, the FAIR Island Project and Tetiaroa Society are developing the **Tetiaroa Data Trust** as a core component of the Tetiaroa IDEA. 

# Purpose of this Agreement

The current document defines the terms under which Tetiaroa Society grants participants in scientific research projects access to Tetiaroa. All projects contribute to the **Tetiaroa IDEA** by making available (eventually in the **Tetiaroa** **Data Trust**) their project description, data management plan, (meta)data and other project outputs, while all participants agree to abide by the **IDEA Consortium** code of conduct (see [Exhibit 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KCW4U-idpzKaT60OAD77BXjRNNp7b5F/edit#heading=h.rgpvrwgfnkbg)).

# Article 1 -- Convention

In return for the permission and support provided by Tetiaroa Society to access Tetiaroa for research purposes, principal investigators and participants in all scientific projects on the atoll agree to:

\

**Applications**

-   Provide ORCID IDs for all participants

    -   Participants are defined as those likely to be co-authors of publications / other products.

-   Complete TS online application and provide a 'marker paper' for publication by TS 

    -   The marker paper is a project description with a unique identifier (DOI) that serves as a record of the initial aims, providing an important narrative form of metadata. 

-   Include a Data Management Plan (DMP) for publication by TS

    -   Use the Data Management Plan Tool or equivalent to describe intended outputs including:

        -   datasets generated by the Project

        -   original software created in the course of the Project

        -   physical / material samples collected or created on Tetiaroa

    -   List any intended intellectual property (e.g., patents, copyright, design rights and confidential know-how)

    -   Describe any potential ethical, legal, or social consequences arising from the collection, distribution, use or reuse of samples or data and how these will be addressed

    -   [See a draft  [Data Management Plan template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IzE4Nj0AMvV9yzmuUAjE0Nng0G0oFsSA) - this will be updated as architecture of the Tetiaroa Data Trust and related cyberinfrastructure is finalized through FAIR Island Project and related efforts.]

\

Review process: All scientific research projects are reviewed by Tetiaroa Society's (TS) Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) prior to TS approval to access the atoll. Review by other entities (e.g., government agencies) might also be required depending on the nature of the research. Each project's Data Management Plan (DMP) is reviewed by the TS Science Director and ~~a~~ Research Data Management advisors (with support of the FAIR Island Project). Modifications of the DMP might be required.

\

**Reports**

-   Projects are required to submit annual and final reports for publication by TS with particular attention to describing data and other outputs:

    -   These 'data papers' will leverage machine-actionable DMPs developed by the FAIR Island Project.

    -   Details/copies of raw and processed (meta)data and other project outputs are deposited in the Tetiaroa Data Trust and made available under the terms described in this Agreement.

-   Projects agree to maintain identifiers and linkages generated during the project and to connect them to future derived outputs, enabling dynamic updates to the Tetiaroa Data Trust.   

# Article 2 -- Terms of Use

Unless data or other project outputs are subject to special treatment (e.g., due to ethical, legal, social aspects - see Article 5), as agreed in the Project's approved Data Management Plan, all metadata and data are contributed to the Tetiaroa Data Trust under the following license:

-   TBD [perhaps the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license].

\

**Commercial use** of data, material samples, or other outputs originating from projects on Tetiaroa requires authorization from Tetiaroa Society under separate project-specific agreements. Commercial use is defined here as:

\

-   Commercial product development; the sale, lease, or license of the Outputs; using the Outputs to produce or manufacture products for general sale, not including publications and/or copyrightable works; transferring tangible rights by sale or license resulting in payment beyond cost; conducting market research; seeking pre-market approval.

# Article 3 -- Embargo Period & Prepublication Release

By default, there is no embargo period on the release of data under the terms of Article 2. If requested, however, an embargo period may be granted for up to [1 year] after the stated end date of the Project (as specified in its Data Management Plan). During any embargo period, metadata is publicly available but **pre-publication access and use** of the data is permitted **only for TS personnel and other IDEA Consortium collaborators** who have agreed to abide by the IDEA Code of Conduct (see Exhibit 1). 

# Article 4 -- Material Samples 

Each project's Data Management Plan shall detail access of material samples - whether archeological, geological/chemical, and biological. Accessing samples includes physical collection and removal, and/or copying through imaging, recording, or sequencing technologies. Projects shall describe how they plan to register these sampling events, apply unique identifiers, implement relevant metadata standards, and track derived material samples, data, and derived outputs. 

\

In the case of biological samples, the Tetiaroa Society has established the **Tetiaroa Biocode & Omic Observatory**, a scientific research program in collaboration with the Research, Higher Education and Innovation Consortium of French Polynesia ("RESIPOL") with the following objectives: 

\

1.  to comprehensively inventory the biodiversity of Tetiaroa, including all species of fauna and flora -- plants, animals, algae, fungi, and microbial groups;

2.  to generate time-series biodiversity observations at the molecular level, including DNA sequencing and other "multi-omic" approaches. 

3.   to test new technological and scientific approaches for the analysis of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes in general; and to make Materials and information available to the research community. 

In accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol) and associated regulations of the French Polynesian government, all biosamples collected on Tetiaroa contribute to the Tetiaroa Biocode & Omic Observatory and shall comply with the "[Tetiaroa Access & Benefit Sharing (ABS) Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W0SK1YihP2eHkt7WhOwJBp5mhy7o1HBx)". 

# Article 5 -- Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects 

Some data types or samples require special consideration, and in some cases permits, such as those associated with traditional knowledge, archeological artifacts, endangered species, medical data, and human subject research. These may be reviewed by the TS Scientific and Cultural Advisory Boards. As appropriate, projects are encouraged to consider the use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, developed to: "support Native, First Nations, Aboriginal, and Indigenous communities in the management of their intellectual property and cultural heritage specifically within the digital environment", and BioCultural (BC) Labels, which extends the TK Label initiative to genetic resources.

# Article 6 -- Dispute Resolution

Disputes concerning the use of data or samples are adjudicated by Tetiaroa Society with input from its Advisory Boards, which will hear from both sides and make recommendations. Sanctions for failing to comply with the IDEA Code of Conduct or other aspects of the Tetiaroa Data Policy may include the rescinding of rights to access Tetiaroa.

# Exhibit -- IDEA Code of Conduct

The following is adapted from the Toronto Statement on Prepublication International Data Sharing. 

\

Participants in the IDEA Consortium agree to abide by the following principles:

\

**Respect the Privacy, Ethical, and Legal rights** of anyone, including Indigenous peoples, who might be adversely affected by the collection, distribution, use or reuse of data, samples or derived information and knowledge. Apply consent, confidentiality, anonymization and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

\

**Rapid prepublication data release to** the IDEA Consortium (e.g., through one of its regional chapters such as the Tetiaroa IDEA), which is a program with the following characteristics:

-   Large scale (requiring significant resources over time) and broad utility

-   Creating reference data sets

-   Associated with community buy-in

\

**Coordinating nodes** (e.g., Tetiaroa Society for the Tetiaroa IDEA)shouldfacilitate the specification of data-release policies and compliance with agreed Data Management Plans by:

-   Explicitly informing applicants of data-release requirements, especially mandatory prepublication data release 

-   Ensuring that evaluation of data release plans is part of the peer-review process 

-   Proactively establishing analysis plans and timelines for projects releasing data prepublication

-   Fostering investigator-initiated prepublication data release

-   Helping to develop appropriate consent, security, access and governance mechanisms that protect research participants while encouraging prepublication data release

-   Providing long-term support of databases

\

**Project leaders** should state their intentions and enable analyses of their data or material samples by:

-   Informing data/sample users (e.g., through a 'marker paper' at initiation of the project) about the data/samples being generated, data standards and quality, planned analyses, timelines, and relevant contact information

-   Providing relevant metadata and documentation that will assist other researchers in reproducing and/or independently analyzing the data, while protecting privacy and other ethical, legal, and social aspects concerning individuals and communities

-   Ensuring that all participants in their Project are informed that their data will be shared with other scientists in the IDEA Consortium and the associated terms

-   Publishing their initial global analyses in a timely fashion

-   Providing a copy of their data, protocols, software and other outputs, in an easily retrievable form and with appropriate metadata and documentation that facilitates usage of both pre-processed and processed data (e.g., following FAIR data principles) 

-   Ensuring the long-term maintenance of these resources (e.g., through deposition in appropriate repositories and collections).

\

**Data analysts/users** should freely analyze released prepublication data or samples and act responsibly in publishing their analyses by:

-   Respecting the scientific etiquette that allows data producers to publish the first global analyses of their data set 

-   Reading the citable document(s) associated with the project (e.g., 'marker paper')

-   Accurately and completely citing the source of prepublication data, including the version of the data set 

-   Being aware that released prepublication data may be associated with quality issues that will be later rectified by the data producers

-   Contacting the data producers to discuss publication plans in the case of overlap between planned analyses

-   Ensuring that use of data does not harm participants and is in conformity with ethical, legal, and social aspects and approvals
