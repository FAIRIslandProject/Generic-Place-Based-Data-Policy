# Tetiaroa IDEA Data Policy

Tetiaroa Society, French Polynesia

\

# Preamble

The owner of Tetiaroa private island, Frangipani Unlimited SA, has entrusted **Tetiaroa Society (TS)** as the atoll's environmental steward with authority to develop and implement the **Tetiaroa Conservation & Sustainable Use Plan (CASUP)**. Tetiaroa Society manages access to the atoll for research, education, and conservation, or any other purposes not directly linked to The Brando Resort, which is located on one of the atoll's 12 islets (motus). All projects are authorized by Tetiaroa Society after review of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Cultural Advisory Board (CAB), and/or CASUP Committee, as appropriate. The handling of **research data** and other research outputs, including material samples and intellectual property, is a key consideration for Tetiaroa Society and the current document sets out its policy in this regard. Tetiaroa Society delegates responsibility for governance of the **Tetiaroa Data Trust** (defined herein) to ~~a joint committee of~~ its Scientific ~~and Cultural~~ Advisory Board~~s, to be established by the SAB and CAB chairs~~. Tetiaroa Society participates in two programs that provide a framework for its research data policy and the Tetiaroa Data Trust:

\

### Tetiaroa IDEA

Tetiaroa Society shares the goals of the **Island Digital Ecosystem Avatars (IDEA) Consortium** to build use-oriented 4-D simulations (avatars) of entire social-ecological systems. An avatar is the digital representation of the data and knowledge about a place, enabling actions (e.g., conservation management) to be assessed in silico prior to deploying them in the real world. **Tetiaroa IDEA** is coordinated by Tetiaroa Society to facilitate scenario-based planning and to serve as a decision-support tool for the Tetiaroa CASUP. 

\

### FAIR Island Project 

The stewardship of research data and samples underpins scientific reproducibility, synthesis, and reuse. Embedded in a broad international research network, Tetiaroa is the key use case for the FAIR Island Project ([www.fairisland.org](http://www.fairisland.org)), which aims to demonstrate the benefits of global best-practice in data stewardship. Drawing on inter alia the 'FAIR' data principles and the CARE principles for ~~i~~Indigenous data governance, the FAIR Island Project and Tetiaroa Society are developing the **Tetiaroa Data Trust** as a core component of the Tetiaroa IDEA. 

# Purpose of this Agreement

The current document defines the terms under which participants in scientific research projects on Tetiaroa are granted access to Tetiaroa by Tetiaroa Society. All participants in said projects agree to contribute to the **Tetiaroa IDEA** ~~by using **FAIR Island** infrastructure to~~by ~~submit~~depositing project descriptions, data management plans~~, and reports, and to deposit all~~ , (meta)data and other project outputs in the **Tetiaroa** **Data Trust**, ~~. Participants contributing to and accessing the Tetiaroa Data Trust~~ and agreeing to abide by the code of conduct established by the **IDEA Consortium** (see [Exhibit 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KCW4U-idpzKaT60OAD77BXjRNNp7b5F/edit#heading=h.rgpvrwgfnkbg)).

# Article 1 -- Convention

In return for Tetiaroa Society (TS) granting permission to access Tetiaroa for research purposes, ~~leaders (~~principal investigators~~)~~ and participants in all scientific projects on Tetiaroa agree to:

\

**Applications**

-   Provide ORCID IDs for all participants

    -   Participants are defined as those likely to be co-authors of publications / other products.

-   ~~Submit with their~~Complete TS online application through the RAMS portal (provided by UC NRS) ~~a~~and provide a 'marker paper' ~~(~~Description with DOI~~)~~ for publication by TS 

    -   ~~A~~The marker paper is a project description ~~with unique~~with a unique identifier (DOI) ~~serves~~that serves as a record of the initial aims, providing an important narrative form of metadata. 

-   Include a Data Management Plan (DMP) ~~(~~DMP with DOI~~)~~ for publication by TS

    -   Use Data Management Plan Tool or equivalent to describe intended outputs including:

        -   datasets generated by the Project

        -   original software created in the course of the Project

        -   physical / material samples collected or created on Tetiaroa

    -   List any intended intellectual property (e.g., patents, copyright, design rights and confidential know-how)

    -   Describe any potential ethical, legal, or social consequences arising from the collection, distribution, use or reuse of samples or data and how these will be addressed

    -   [See a draft  [Data Management Plan template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IzE4Nj0AMvV9yzmuUAjE0Nng0G0oFsSA) - this will be updated as architecture of the Tetiaroa Data Trust and related cyberinfrastructure is finalized through FAIR Island Project and related efforts.]

\

Review process: All ~~proposed~~ scientific research projects ~~on Tetiaroa~~ must be reviewed by Tetiaroa Society's (TS) Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) prior to approval of access to the atoll. Review by other entities (e.g., government agencies) might also be required depending on the nature of the research. ~~The SAB evaluates the marker paper and recommends whether TS should accept it for publication.~~ Each project's DMP is reviewed by the TS Science Director and a Research Data Management advisor (with support of the FAIR Island Project). Modifications of the DMP might be required before TS will finalize approval for the project to access the atoll.

\

**Reports**

-   Projects are required to ~~S~~submit reports (data papers) for publication by TS annually and ~~a 'data paper' (~~Report with DOI~~) annually and~~ on completion of the project ~~for publication by TS~~:

    -   Data papers leverage FAIR Island Project infrastructure (e.g., machine-actionable DMPs).

    -   Details/copies of raw and processed (meta)data and other project outputs are deposited in the Tetiaroa Data Trust under the terms described in this Agreement.

    -   ~~Submit new version of Data Management Plan, if needed, for publication by TS~~

-   ~~M~~Projects agree to ~~ake a good-faith effort to~~ maintain identifiers and linkages generated during the project and to connect them to future derived outputs ~~to enable~~ , enabling dynamic updates to the Tetiaroa Data Trust.   

# Article 2 -- Terms of Use

Unless data or other project outputs are subject to special treatment (e.g., due to ethical, legal, social aspects - see Article 5), as agreed in the Project's approved Data Management Plan, all metadata and data are contributed to the Tetiaroa Data Trust under the following license:

-   TBD [perhaps the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license].

\

**Commercial use** of data, material samples, or other outputs ~~(hereinafter the "Outputs")~~ originating from Tetiaroa requires authorization from Tetiaroa Society under separate project-specific agreements. Commercial use is defined here as:

\

-   Commercial product development; the sale, lease, or license of the Outputs; using the Outputs to produce or manufacture products for general sale, not including publications and/or copyrightable works; transferring tangible rights by sale or license resulting in payment beyond cost; conducting market research; seeking pre-market approval.

# Article 3 -- Embargo Period & Prepublication Release

The default is no embargo period. ~~Projects are encouraged to waive an embargo period.~~ If requested, an embargo period may be granted for up to [1 year] after the end date of the Project as specified in its Data Management Plan. During any embargo period, metadata is publicly available but **pre-publication access and use** of the data is permitted **only for TS personnel and any third parties who have all agreed to abide by the IDEA Code of Conduct** (see Exhibit 1). After any embargo period, TS may release data under the default license established for the Tetiaroa Data Trust (see Article 2).

# Article 4 -- Material Samples 

Each project's Data Management Plan also considers accessing and digitizing (e.g., imaging, recording, sequencing) archeological, geological/chemical, and biological material samples~~, including archeological, geochemical (geosamples), and biological (biosamples) materials~~. Any collection of material samples on Tetiaroa shall register sampling events, apply unique identifiers, implement relevant metadata standards, and track derived material samples, data, and outputs. ~~Furthermore, i~~

\

In the case of biological samples, the Tetiaroa Society has established the **Tetiaroa Biocode & Omic Observatory**, a scientific research program in collaboration with the Research, Higher Education and Innovation Consortium of French Polynesia ("RESIPOL") with the following objectives: 

\

1.  to comprehensively inventory the biodiversity of Tetiaroa, including all species of fauna and flora -- plants, animals, algae, fungi, and microbial groups;

2.  to generate time-series biodiversity observations at the molecular level, including DNA sequencing and other "multi-omic" approaches. 

3.   to test new technological and scientific approaches for the analysis of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes in general; and to make Materials and information available to the research community. 

In accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol) and associated regulations of the French Polynesian government, all ~~Projects collecting~~ biosamples collected on Tetiaroa contribute to the Tetiaroa Biocode & Omic Observatory and shall ~~must~~ comply with the "[Tetiaroa Access & Benefit Sharing (ABS) Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W0SK1YihP2eHkt7WhOwJBp5mhy7o1HBx)"~~.~~ . 

\

# Article 5 -- Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects 

Some data types or samples require special consideration, and in some cases permits, such as those associated with traditional knowledge, archeological artifacts, endangered species, medical data, and human subject research. These ~~will~~ may be reviewed ~~on a case by case basis~~ by the TS Scientific and Cultural Advisory Boards. ~~Specific recommendations might include, for example,~~As appropriate, projects are encouraged to consider the use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, ~~which were~~ developed to: "support Native, First Nations, Aboriginal, and Indigenous communities in the management of their intellectual property and cultural heritage specifically within the digital environment", and BioCultural (BC) Labels, which extends the TK Label initiative to genetic resources.

# Article 6 -- Dispute Resolution

Disputes concerning the use of data or samples are adjudicated by Tetiaroa Society with input from its Advisory Boards, which will hear from both sides and make recommendations. Sanctions for failing to comply with the IDEA Code of Conduct or other aspects of the Tetiaroa Data Policy may include the rescinding of rights to access Tetiaroa.

\

# Exhibit -- IDEA Code of Conduct

The following is adapted from the Toronto Statement on Prepublication International Data Sharing. 

\

Participants in the IDEA Consortium agree to abide by the following principles:

\

**Respect the Privacy, Ethical, and Legal rights** of anyone, including Indigenous peoples, who might be adversely affected by the collection, distribution, use or reuse of data, samples or derived information and knowledge. Apply consent, confidentiality, anonymization and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

\

**Rapid prepublication data release to** the IDEA Consortium (e.g., through one of its regional chapters such as the Tetiaroa IDEA), which is a program with the following characteristics:

-   Large scale (requiring significant resources over time) and broad utility

-   Creating reference data sets

-   Associated with community buy-in

\

**Coordinating nodes** (e.g., Tetiaroa Society for the Tetiaroa IDEA)shouldfacilitate the specification of data-release policies and compliance with agreed Data Management Plans by:

-   Explicitly informing applicants of data-release requirements, especially mandatory prepublication data release 

-   Ensuring that evaluation of data release plans is part of the peer-review process 

-   Proactively establishing analysis plans and timelines for projects releasing data prepublication

-   Fostering investigator-initiated prepublication data release

-   Helping to develop appropriate consent, security, access and governance mechanisms that protect research participants while encouraging prepublication data release

-   Providing long-term support of databases

\

**Project leaders** should state their intentions and enable analyses of their data or material samples by:

-   Informing data/sample users (e.g., through a 'marker paper' at initiation of the project) about the data/samples being generated, data standards and quality, planned analyses, timelines, and relevant contact information

-   Providing relevant metadata and documentation that will assist other researchers in reproducing and/or independently analyzing the data, while protecting privacy and other ethical, legal, and social aspects concerning individuals and communities

-   Ensuring that all participants in their Project are informed that their data will be shared with other scientists in the IDEA Consortium and the associated terms

-   Publishing their initial global analyses in a timely fashion

-   Providing a copy of their data, protocols, software and other outputs, in an easily retrievable form and with appropriate metadata and documentation that facilitates usage of both pre-processed and processed data (e.g., following FAIR data principles) 

-   Ensuring the long-term maintenance of these resources (e.g., through deposition in appropriate repositories and collections).

\

**Data analysts/users** should freely analyze released prepublication data or samples and act responsibly in publishing their analyses by:

-   Respecting the scientific etiquette that allows data producers to publish the first global analyses of their data set 

-   Reading the citable document(s) associated with the project (e.g., 'marker paper')

-   Accurately and completely citing the source of prepublication data, including the version of the data set 

-   Being aware that released prepublication data may be associated with quality issues that will be later rectified by the data producers

-   Contacting the data producers to discuss publication plans in the case of overlap between planned analyses

Ensuring that use of data does not harm participants and is in conformity with ethical, legal, and social aspects and approvals
