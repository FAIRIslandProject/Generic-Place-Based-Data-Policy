# Preamble

Frangipani Unlimited SA, the owner of Tetiaroa, a private island in French Polynesia, has formally entrusted **Tetiaroa Society (TS)** as the atoll's environmental steward with authority to develop and implement the **Tetiaroa Conservation & Sustainable Use Plan (CASUP)**. Tetiaroa Society manages access to the atoll for research, education, and conservation, or any other purposes not directly linked to The Brando Resort (which is owned and operated by leaseholders, Tahiti Beachcomber SA, on two of the atoll's 12 islets). All projects are authorized by Tetiaroa Society after review of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Cultural Advisory Board (CAB), and/or CASUP Committee, as appropriate. The handling of data and other outputs, including material samples and intellectual property, is a key consideration, and the current document sets out TS policy in this regard.

\

## Tetiaroa IDEA

Tetiaroa Society is part of the **Island Digital Ecosystem Avatars (IDEA) Consortium**, an international scientific collaboration that is building use-oriented 4-D digital simulations (avatars) of entire social-ecological systems. Anavatar in this context is the digital representation of all the data and knowledge about a place, and as such, the **Tetiaroa IDEA** serves as a decision-support tool for Tetiaroa Society (scenario-based planning for the Tetiaroa CASUP). 

\

### FAIR Island

Data and sample curation underpin scientific reproducibility, synthesis, and reuse. Application of 'FAIR' data principles helps maintain the linkages among diverse data types that are essential for downstream integration, analysis, and modeling (e.g., in the Tetiaroa IDEA). Embedded in a broad international research network, Tetiaroa provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of global data standards and best-in-class tools when they are applied universally across domains. 

\

In recognition of this opportunity, all participants in scientific projects on Tetiaroa agree to:

-   participate in the Tetiaroa IDEA and join the IDEA Consortium

-   deposit a copy of their data in the **Tetiaroa** **Data Trust** (e.g., using Dryad ) 

-   manage biosamples in the **Tetiaroa Biocode Observatory** (e.g., using GEOME)

-   facilitate provenance, attribution, and compliance (e.g., using EvolutionXD)

-   abide by the principles of the IDEA Consortium (see Exhibit 1)

# Article 1 -- Convention

All scientific projects on Tetiaroa agree to:

\

-   **At application**

    -   **Submit a marker paper (Project Description) for publication by TS**

        -   This paper states the project's initial aims and serves as an historical reference providing important narrative metadata. 

    -   **Provide ORCID ID for all project participants**

        -   **Those likely to be co-authors on publications or other products.**

    -   **Include a data management plan (DMP)**

        -   Using the Data Management Plan Tool or equivalent to describe the following:

        -   datasets generated by the Project

        -   original software created in the course of the Project

        -   physical / material samples collected or created on Tetiaroa

<!-- -->

-   IP such as patents, copyright, design rights and confidential know-how

-   Identify any potential privacy, ethical, or legal consequences arising from the collection, distribution, use or reuse of samples and data

<!-- -->

-   **During the project**

    -   **Submit data papers (Annual Reports) for publication by TS**

        -   **A progress report updating the initial marker paper, with copies of raw and processed data and any derived data products, including metadata and the location of any other outputs.**

-   **After the project**

    -   **Provide copies of all data underpinning scientific papers as well as updates, corrections and modifications to project data**

        -   **Copies of data are provided where permissible under applicable government regulations**

# Article 2 -- Terms of Use

Data not subject to special treatment for privacy, ethical or legal reasons (see Article 5) remain the property of the provider (Project) and are contributed to Tetiaroa Society (Tetiaroa Data Trust) under a **Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial** license:

-   Attribution --- You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

-   Non-Commercial --- You may not use the material for commercial purposes.

-   No additional restrictions --- You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

**Pre-publication use** by TS or third parties within the IDEA Consortium should comply with the IDEA Code of Conduct (see Exhibit 1). **Commercial use** of data, material samples, or other outputs of projects carried out on Tetiaroa requires authorization from Tetiaroa Society under separate project-specific agreements.

# Article 3 -- Embargo Period & Prepublication Release

Project leaders are encouraged to waive an embargo period. If requested, an embargo period may be granted for up to 1 year after data are generated. During any embargo period, TS is free to share the material in any medium or format with other members of the IDEA Consortium (see Exhibit 1: the IDEA Code of Conduct). TS and IDEA Consortium may also Adapt (i.e., remix, transform, and build upon) the material. After any embargo period, TS may release the data to the general public under CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

# Article 4 -- Material Samples 

A key aspect of the Tetiaroa IDEA involves accessing and digitizing (e.g., imaging, recording, sequencing) material samples, including archeological, geochemical (geosamples), and biological (biosamples) materials. Any collecting of material samples on Tetiaroa must use the iSAMPLES (GEOME, IGSN/SESAR, Open Context) cyberinfrastructure, or equivalent, to register sampling events, apply unique identifiers, implement relevant metadata standards, and track derived material samples, data, and outputs. Furthermore, in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity and associated regulations of the French Polynesian government, all Projects collecting biosamples on Tetiaroa must comply with the "Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory Access & Benefit Sharing Agreement" (see Exhibit 4). Note: the Biocode Observatory ABS does not cover Traditional Ecological Knowledge, which has additional requirements (see Article 5).

# Article 5 -- Privacy, Ethical, and Legal Considerations 

The Tetiaroa IDEA covers all data types, not all of which should be made available through the Tetiaroa Data Trust. In some cases, privacy, legal, and ethical considerations make open data approaches inappropriate and special treatment of these data are justified or legally required. Exceptions might include inter alia traditional knowledge, archeological artifacts, medical data, and human subject research. The procedures described here (including project proposals and data management plans) are intended to identify issues and enable institutional review boards (TS Scientific and Cultural Advisory Boards) make specific recommendations (e.g., use of approaches developed by 'Local Contexts', an initiative to: "support Native, First Nations, Aboriginal, and Indigenous communities in the management of their intellectual property and cultural heritage specifically within the digital environment").

# Article 6 -- Dispute Resolution

Any disputes concerning the use of data or samples under the Tetiaroa IDEA is adjudicated by the appropriate Tetiaroa Society with input from its Advisory Boards (SAB, CAB, CASUP). The Boards will hear from both sides and make recommendations to the Tetiaroa Society. Sanctions for failing to comply with the IDEA Code of Conduct or other aspects of the Tetiaroa Data Policy may include the rescinding of rights to access Tetiaroa and expulsion from the IDEA Consortium.

# Exhibits

\

## Exhibit 1 -- IDEA Code of Conduct

The following is adapted from the Toronto Statement on Prepublication International Data Sharing. 

\

Participants in the IDEA Consortium agree to abide by the following principles:

\

**Respect the Privacy, Ethical, and Legal rights** of anyone who might be adversely affected by the collection, distribution, use or reuse of data, samples or derived information and knowledge. Apply consent, confidentiality, anonymization and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

\

**Rapid prepublication data release to** the IDEA Consortium (e.g., through Tetiaroa IDEA), a program:

-   Of large scale (requiring significant resources over time) and broad utility

-   Creating reference data sets

-   Associated with community buy-in

\

**IDEA Coordinating nodes** (e.g., Tetiaroa Society for Tetiaroa IDEA)shouldfacilitate the specification of data-release policies by:

-   Explicitly informing applicants of data-release requirements, especially mandatory prepublication data release 

-   Ensuring that evaluation of data release plans is part of the peer-review process 

-   Proactively establishing analysis plans and timelines for projects releasing data prepublication

-   Fostering investigator-initiated prepublication data release

-   Helping to develop appropriate consent, security, access and governance mechanisms that protect research participants while encouraging prepublication data release

-   Providing long-term support of databases

\

**Data producers** should state their intentions and enable analyses of their data by:

-   Informing data users (e.g., through a 'marker paper' at initiation of the project) about the data being generated, data standards and quality, planned analyses, timelines, and relevant contact information

-   Providing relevant metadata that will assist other researchers in reproducing and/or independently analyzing the data, while protecting privacy and interests of individuals enrolled in studies focusing on humans

-   Ensuring that research participants in their Project are informed that their data will be shared with other scientists in the IDEA Consortium

-   Publishing their initial global analyses in a timely fashion

-   Providing a copy of their data, which can also be done through creating databases designed to archive all data (including underlying raw data) in an easily retrievable form and facilitate usage of both pre-processed and processed data (e.g., following FAIR data principles).

\

**Data analysts/users** (IDEA Consortium members) should freely analyze released prepublication data and act responsibly in publishing analyses of those data by:

-   Respecting the scientific etiquette that allows data producers to publish the first global analyses of their data set 

-   Reading the citable document(s) associated with the project (e.g., 'marker paper')

-   Accurately and completely citing the source of prepublication data, including the version of the data set 

-   Being aware that released prepublication data may be associated with quality issues that will be later rectified by the data producers

-   Contacting the data producers to discuss publication plans in the case of overlap between planned analyses

-   Ensuring that use of data does not harm research participants and is in conformity with ethical approvals

## Exhibit 2 -- IDEA Data Management Plan Template 

The following is an example modified from the DMP Template of DCC Digital Curation Centre. The final DMP template should be posted as an online form/s (Tetiaroa IDEA DMP) that all projects will be required to complete as part of the application process to access Tetiaroa, using the Data Management Plan Tool or equivalent.

\

#### 1. Data Types, Formats, Standards and Capture Methods

1.  **What data outputs will your research generate?**

2.  **Outline volume, type, content, quality and format of the final dataset.**

3.  **Outline the metadata, documentation or other supporting material that should accompany the data for it to be interpreted correctly.**

4.  **What standards and methodologies will be utilized for data collection and management?**

5.  **State the relationship to other data available in public repositories (e.g. existing data sources that will be used by the research project); gaps between available data and that required for the research; the added value that new data would provide in relation to existing data.**

\

Notes: You should detail what data you will create and explain why you have opted for particular formats, standards and methodologies. You should capture your data in (or convert it to) community-accepted data formats where available. Using standard or widely-adopted formats will make your data interoperable. Open or non-proprietary formats are preferable, as you and others will have less trouble processing these later. Your data should be deposited into an archive, and particular formats may be necessary. Documentation and metadata allow your data to be understood and discovered by others. It is fundamental to capture contextual details about how and why the data were created. Metadata is a subset of this broad documentation, describing the data in detail. There are various metadata standards which can help you to describe your data in a consistent way. 

\

#### 2. Ethics and Intellectual Property

1.  **Demonstrate that you have sought advice on and addressed all copyright and rights management issues that apply to the resource.**

2.  **Make explicit mention of consent, confidentiality, anonymization and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.**

3.  **Are any restrictions on data sharing required -- for example to safeguard research participants or to gain appropriate intellectual property protection?**

\

Notes: Explain any constraints, such as embargo periods or restricted access BEYOND THOSE SPECIFIED IN THE IDEA CONSORTIUM DATA POLICY, and ensure these are properly justified as research data under the auspices of TETIAROA SOCIETY (TETIAROA IDEA) should be openly available as soon as possible. These justifications may also be of use in the event of a Freedom of Information request for your research data. All research involving human data or material is subject to formal ethical review. Where appropriate, you should outline the steps you will take to protect research participants (e.g., anonymizing data). It helps to show that you've balanced concerns with the desire to share (e.g., by negotiating informed consent for data sharing). 

\

#### 3. Access, Data Sharing and Reuse

1.  **What are the further intended and/or foreseeable research uses for the completed dataset(s)?**

2.  **Apart from providing a copy of your data to Tetiaroa Society, how else do you intend to make the resource accessible?**

3.  **State any expected difficulties in data sharing, along with causes and possible measures to overcome these difficulties.**

4.  **How will data sharing provide opportunities for coordination or collaboration?**

\

Notes: Tetiaroa Society requires all projects meet minimum quality standards to make sure their data can be understood and reused by other researchers. See Tetiaroa IDEA Data Policy.

\

#### 4. Short-Term Storage and Data Management

1.  **Describe the planned quality assurance and back-up procedures [security/storage].**

2.  **Specify the responsibilities for data management and curation within research teams participating in your project at all participating institutions.**

\

Notes: Be clear about who will be responsible for different tasks. Are the investigators co-located, or will you need infrastructure that accommodates secure remote access? How will data quality be monitored if you are working in a distributed network across several sites? You may apply differing levels of service or adopt a combination of approaches:

-   Security may be more robust for any sensitive data you collect than for secondary data you hold under license. Think about how you will transfer data securely (e.g., encrypting data or using secure online storage). If using online services, you should know where your data are hosted and be certain that this is legally permissible.

-   Back-up of your unique data is more critical than copies of secondary data. The more important the data and the more often it is used, the more regularly it needs to be backed up. Fully managed file services with automated back-up, such as those offered by university IT services, are very robust and save you the time and effort of implementing your own system. Such services could be used in combination with portable storage or cloud computing to meet particular needs.

#### Deposit and Long-Term Preservation

1.  **Identify which of the data sets produced are considered to be of long-term value.**

2.  **Apart from providing a copy of data to Tetiaroa Society, outline any other plans for preparing and documenting data for preservation and sharing.**

3.  **Similarly, apart from providing a copy of data to Tetiaroa Society, explain any other archiving/preservation plan to ensure the long-term value of key datasets.**

\

Notes: Deciding what has long-term value and preparing those data to expected standards for deposit are time-consuming processes, for which you should allocate significant resources. It is a common expectation that published results will include information on how to access the supporting data. The Tetiaroa IDEA will provide one home for your data. You might have other homes for some or all of your data and these should be indicated. The data which underpin publications should be extracted, captured in machine-readable form and deposited with Tetiaroa Society (in addition to any other data centers) so they remain accessible. 

\

#### Resourcing

-   **What resources will you require to deliver your plan?**

-   **Outline additional hardware, software and technical expertise, support and training that is likely to be required and how it will be acquired.**

-   **Do you require specific help with this from Tetiaroa Society and/or the IDEA Consortium?**

\

Notes: Show that you have sufficient funding/resources to cover the project's data management support. Creating documentation and making your data understandable to others is very time consuming, so be realistic about how much effort is needed to prepare your data for sharing and preservation.

### Biocode MTA Between TS and Partner Institutions

\

This Material Transfer Agreement ("Agreement"), dated as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the "Effective Date"), is made by and between the Tetiaroa Society ("TS"), and ["Partner Institution Name"] 

WHEREAS, TS desires that the Materials obtained by the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory (the "Materials") be used in academic research and that [Partner Institution Name] will provide custodial, research and storage facilities for the Materials and will provide Materials under their control to qualified Third Party Recipients ("Third Party Recipients")

WHEREAS, TS will provide the Materials to [Partner Institution Name] and [Partner Institution Name] is willing to accept such Materials and is subject to the terms contained in this Agreement.

\

**Article 1 AGREEMENT**

\

TS and ["Partner Institution Name"] (hereinafter "the Parties") agree that ["Partner Institution Name"] is a "Partner Institution" in the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory and will maintain Materials as a "Biocode Repository" as defined in the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory Agreement. Materials are provided by TS to [Partner Institution Name] which has custodial responsibility for those Materials.  

\

**Article 2 DEFINITIONS**

\

The Definitions used in this Agreement are as follows:

1.  Materials are the flora, fauna and microbial life obtained from French Polynesia under the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory, and any progeny, cell extract, genetic material or any other Unmodified Derivative thereof.  Materials also include any Materials contained or incorporated in Modifications.

2.  Modifications are created substances that contain/incorporate the Materials.

3.  Commercial Use means commercial product development; the sale, lease, or license of the Materials; using the Materials to produce or manufacture products for general sale, not including publications and/or copyrightable works; transferring tangible rights by sale or license resulting in payment beyond cost; conducting market research; seeking pre-market approval.

4.  Unmodified Derivatives are substances created by TS that constitute an unmodified functional subunit or product expressed by the original Material. Some examples include: subclones of unmodified cell lines, purified or fractionated subsets of the Material, proteins expressed by DNA/RNA contained in the Material, or monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line of the Material. 

\

5.  Inventions are new uses of the Materials, Unmodified Derivatives or Modifications that are potentially commercially useful

6.  Partner Institutions are the organizations that TS designates as its key collaborators in the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory.  Initially, they include: the Smithsonian Institution, Délégation à la Recherche de la Polynésie Française, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, University of Florida, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Herbier de la Polynésie Française, and Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.  Additional partners may be designated by TS during the Project.

7.  Biocode Repositories are units of TS or a Partner Institution that maintain biological collections and will act as custodians of the Materials collected by the Tetiaroa IDEA Biocode Observatory.

8.  Transfers are when a Biocode Repository provides Materials to a second party without any obligation or expectation that the second party will return the Materials intact and entire to the Biocode Repository.

9.  Loans are the traditional practice of natural history museums to temporarily exchange specimens for scholarly research that does not involve damaging or destroying any of the Materials.  The specimens are returned intact and entire to the loaning institution.  Loans are not considered Transfers of the Materials. 

**Article 3 MANAGEMENT OF MATERIALS**

\

The Materials will only be stored and used by [Partner Institution Name] for non-commercial scientific research, education, and conservation purposes. Further, [Partner Institution Name] will:

\

11. Take all appropriate, reasonable, and necessary measures to transport (export and import) the Materials in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and to contain the Materials so as to prevent the release of invasive alien species;
