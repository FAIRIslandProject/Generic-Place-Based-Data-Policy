# Tetiaroa IDEA Data Policy

Tetiaroa Society, French Polynesia

\

# Preamble

The owners of Tetiaroa have entrusted **Tetiaroa Society** (hereinafter "TS")as the private atoll's environmental steward with authority to develop and implement the **Tetiaroa Conservation & Sustainable Use Plan** (hereinafter the "CASUP"), and to manage access to the atoll for research, education, conservation, or any other purposes not directly linked to The Brando Resort. All projects are authorized by Tetiaroa Society after review of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Cultural Advisory Board (CAB), and/or CASUP Committee, as appropriate. 

\

The handling of research data and other research outputs derived from Tetiaroa, including material samples and intellectual property, is a key consideration for Tetiaroa Society. The current document sets out its policy in this regard. As the environmental steward of the atoll, TS also assumes responsibility for the stewardship of data and material samples derived from the atoll under its auspices. In this role, as the steward of the atoll's "digital twin" or "avatar", TS has established the **Tetiaroa Data Trust**. 

\

Two large-scale collaborative programs provide a framework for TS data stewardship and the Tetiaroa Data Trust:

\

### Tetiaroa IDEA

Tetiaroa Society is a collaborating node of the **Island Digital Ecosystem Avatars (IDEA) Consortium** that aims to build use-oriented 4-D simulations of entire social-ecological systems. Island avatars leverage "digital twin" technology and draw on all the data and knowledge about a place to simulate future states of its social-ecological system under alternative scenarios of human activity and/or environmental change. The **Tetiaroa IDEA** enables potential actions (e.g., conservation management) to be assessed in silico prior to deploying them on the atoll; it thus serves as a decision-support tool for the Tetiaroa CASUP, facilitating scenario-based planning. 

\

### FAIR Island Project 

The stewardship of research dat~~a and~~ a, material samples, and software underpins scientific reproducibility, synthesis, and reuse. Embedded in a multidisciplinary international research network, Tetiaroa is the key use case for the **FAIR Island Project** ([www.fairisland.org](http://www.fairisland.org)), which aims to demonstrate the benefits of global best-practice drawing on the 'FAIR' data principles and the CARE principles for Indigenous data governance. The FAIR Island Project and Tetiaroa Society are developing the Tetiaroa Data Trust as a core component of the Tetiaroa IDEA. 

# Purpose of this Agreement

The current document defines the terms under which Tetiaroa Society grants participants in scientific research projects (hereinafter "Projects") access to Tetiaroa.

# Article 1 -- Convention

1.  In return for the permission and support provided by **Tetiaroa Society** to access Tetiaroa for research purposes, Principal Investigators of all Projects agree to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the atoll by participating in the **Tetiaroa IDEA**, contributing to the **Tetiaroa Data Trust**, and abiding by the **IDEA Consortium Code of Conduct** (see [Exhibit 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KCW4U-idpzKaT60OAD77BXjRNNp7b5F/edit#heading=h.rgpvrwgfnkbg)).

\

2.  Projects agree to make copies of their metadata and data available to the Tetiaroa Data Trust on the terms described in their Project's **Data Management Plan** (hereinafter the "DMP"), which they submit to the TS Science Director and Research Data Management Advisor for review. Modifications of the DMP might be required prior to TS granting the Project approval to access the atoll. Project DMPs shall:

\

1.  Provide ORCID IDs for all participants in the Project

    1.  Participants are defined as the leaders of the Project (Principal Investigators) and subsequently anyone who contributes to the Project (e.g., co-authors of publications / other products) should be added with their ORCID ID.

2.  Use the Data Management Plan Tool or equivalent to describe intended outputs including: datasets; original software; material samples 

3.  List any intended intellectual property (e.g., patents, copyright, design rights and confidential know-how)

4.  Describe potential ethical, legal, or social consequences (including potential commercial uses) arising from the collection, distribution, use or reuse of material samples or data, and describe how these issues will be addressed and by whom.

5.  [See a draft  [Data Management Plan template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IzE4Nj0AMvV9yzmuUAjE0Nng0G0oFsSA) - this will be updated as architecture of the Tetiaroa Data Trust and related cyberinfrastructure is finalized through FAIR Island Project and related efforts.]

\

3.  Projects agree to the publication by TS of a '**Tetiaroa Marker Paper**', authored by the Project's Principal Investigators, drawing on information provided in the Project application and DMP 

    1.  The marker paper is a project description that will be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). It serves as a record of the Project's aims, providing an important narrative form of metadata. 

\

4.  Projects agree to the publication by TS of '**Tetiaroa Data Papers**' (each with a DOI), authored by the Project's Principal Investigators and any other named participants, drawing on information provided in the Project's annual and final reports that:

    1.  Describe data and other outputs, 

    2.  Provide details/copies of raw and processed metadata, data, and other project outputs

    3.  Leverage machine-actionable DMPs developed by the FAIR Island Project.

\

5.  Projects agree to utilize and maintain identifiers and linkages generated during the Project, including the the Tetiaroa Marker Paper DOI, and to connect them to future derived outputs, enabling dynamic updates to the Tetiaroa Data Trust

# Article 2 -- Tetiaroa Data Trust 

1.  The Project agrees that Tetiaroa Society may maintain copies of Project metadata ~~and~~ , data, and software in the Tetiaroa Data Trust. These metadata and data are contributed by the Project on a non-exclusive basis and with "**no rights reserved**" (Creative Commons CC0 license). If justified in the original DMP or its subsequent amendments, TS may agree to more restrictive licenses (e.g., due to ethical, legal, social, or economic aspects - see Article 4) 

\

2.  The Tetiaroa Data Trust is maintained by TS to help ensure that research data, material samples, and software relevant to Tetiaroa are available to enable scientific reproducibility, synthesis, and reuse in accordance with global best-practice. In some cases, and where justified in the Project DMP, the Tetiaroa Data Trust may contain links to metadata, data or software maintained elsewhere rather than actual copies of those resources. 

\

3.  TS agrees to provide stewardship of Project metadata and data in the Tetiaroa Data Trust following the terms outlined in the current document and as agreed in the Project's approved DMP or any agreed amendments thereof. 

\

4.  TS is under no legal obligation to maintain Project metadata or data in the Tetiaroa Data Trust and the Project is responsible for and free to archive its metadata, data, or other outputs elsewhere as appropriate.

\

5.  By default, there is **no embargo period** on the release of metadata or data. If requested and justified in the DMP, however, an embargo period may be granted for specified data (though not for metadata) for up to 1 year after the stated end-date of the Project. 

\

6.  If an embargo period is granted, **pre-publication access and use of the embargoed data** is still permitted for TS personnel and other IDEA Consortium collaborators who have agreed to abide by the IDEA Code of Conduct (see Exhibit 1).

# Article 3 -- Material Samples 

1.  Each project's DMP shall include a description of the physical collection and removal (extraction) of material samples - whether archeological, geological/chemical, biological, or social (built environment). Projects shall describe in their DMP how they plan to register these sampling events, apply unique identifiers,implement relevant metadata standards, and track derived material (sub)samples, (meta)data, and other derived outputs. 

\

2.  In the case of biological samples, the Tetiaroa Society has established the **Tetiaroa Biocode & Genomic Observatory**, a scientific research program in collaboration with the Research, Higher Education and Innovation Consortium of French Polynesia ("RESIPOL") with the following objectives: 

\

1.  to comprehensively inventory the biodiversity of Tetiaroa, including all species of fauna and flora -- plants, animals, algae, fungi, and microbial groups;

2.  to generate time-series biodiversity observations at the molecular level, including nucleotide sequencing and other "multi-omic" approaches. 

3.  to test new technological and scientific approaches for the analysis of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes in general; and to make material samples and information available to the research community. 

\

3.  In accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol) and associated regulations of the French Polynesian government, all biosamples collected on Tetiaroa contribute to the Tetiaroa Biocode & Genomic Observatory and shall comply with the "[Tetiaroa Access & Benefit Sharing (ABS) Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W0SK1YihP2eHkt7WhOwJBp5mhy7o1HBx)" [See Exhibit...]. 

# Article 4 -- Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects 

1.  Certain data types or samples require special consideration, such as, inter alia, data or samples associated with traditional knowledge, archeological artifacts, endangered species, medical data, and human subject research. In some cases, government permits might be required. In other cases, there might be commercial considerations. 

\

2.  Requests to deviate from the default terms described in this document should be submitted to TS with justification in the Project application and DMP, or subsequently if new issues arise. In addition to review by TS Advisory Boards, other Institutional Review Boards or government agencies might be involved as appropriate. 

\

3.  Projects are encouraged to consider the use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, developed to: "support Native, First Nations, Aboriginal, and Indigenous communities in the management of their intellectual property and cultural heritage specifically within the digital environment", and BioCultural (BC) Labels, which extends the TK Label initiative to genetic resources. 

# Article 5 -- Commercial Projects

1.  **Projects with commercial intent** requireauthorization from Tetiaroa Society under separate project-specific agreements. Commercial use is defined here as:

\

1.  Commercial product development; the sale, lease, or license of the Outputs; using the Outputs to produce or manufacture products for general sale, not including publications and/or copyrightable works; transferring tangible rights by sale or license resulting in payment beyond cost; conducting market research; seeking pre-market approval.

# Article 6 -- Dispute Resolution

1.  Disputes concerning the use of data or samples in ways that breach the good-faith engagements made under this data policy are adjudicated by Tetiaroa Society with input from its Advisory Boards, which will hear from both sides and make recommendations. Sanctions for failing to comply with the IDEA Code of Conduct or other aspects of the Tetiaroa Data Policy may include the rescinding of rights to access Tetiaroa.

2.  This dispute resolution mechanism does not cover breaches of applicable laws or regulations, which shall be dealt with by the competent authorities.

\

# Article 7 -- Financial Aspects

1.  Nothing in this document commits TS or any other parties financially.

# Exhibit -- IDEA Code of Conduct

The following is adapted from the Toronto Statement on Prepublication International Data Sharing. 

\

Participants in the IDEA Consortium agree to abide by the following principles:

\

**Respect the Privacy, Ethical, and Legal rights** of anyone, including Indigenous peoples, who might be adversely affected by the collection, distribution, use or reuse of data, samples or derived information and knowledge. Apply consent, confidentiality, anonymization and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

\

**Rapid prepublication data release to** the IDEA Consortium (e.g., through one of its regional chapters such as the Tetiaroa IDEA), which is a program with the following characteristics:

-   Large scale (requiring significant resources over time) and broad utility

-   Creating reference data sets

-   Associated with community buy-in

\

**Coordinating nodes** (e.g., Tetiaroa Society for the Tetiaroa IDEA)shouldfacilitate the specification of data-release policies and compliance with agreed Data Management Plans by:

-   Explicitly informing applicants of data-release requirements, especially mandatory prepublication data release 

-   Ensuring that evaluation of data release plans is part of the peer-review process 

-   Proactively establishing analysis plans and timelines for projects releasing data prepublication

-   Fostering investigator-initiated prepublication data release

-   Helping to develop appropriate consent, security, access and governance mechanisms that protect research participants while encouraging prepublication data release

-   Providing long-term support of databases

\

**Project leaders** should state their intentions and enable analyses of their data or material samples by:

-   Informing data/sample users (e.g., through a 'marker paper' at initiation of the project) about the data/samples being generated, data standards and quality, planned analyses, timelines, and relevant contact information

-   Providing relevant metadata and documentation that will assist other researchers in reproducing and/or independently analyzing the data, while protecting privacy and other ethical, legal, and social aspects concerning individuals and communities

-   Ensuring that all participants in their Project are informed that their data will be shared with other scientists in the IDEA Consortium and the associated terms

-   Publishing their initial global analyses in a timely fashion

-   Providing a copy of their data, protocols, software and other outputs, in an easily retrievable form and with appropriate metadata and documentation that facilitates usage of both pre-processed and processed data (e.g., following FAIR data principles) 

-   Ensuring the long-term maintenance of these resources (e.g., through deposition in appropriate repositories and collections).

\

**Data analysts/users** should freely analyze released prepublication data or samples and act responsibly in publishing their analyses by:

-   Respecting the scientific etiquette that allows data producers to publish the first global analyses of their data set 

-   Reading the citable document(s) associated with the project (e.g., 'marker paper')

-   Accurately and completely citing the source of prepublication data, including the version of the data set 

-   Being aware that released prepublication data may be associated with quality issues that will be later rectified by the data producers

-   Contacting the data producers to discuss publication plans in the case of overlap between planned analyses

-   Ensuring that use of data does not harm participants and is in conformity with ethical, legal, and social aspects and approvals
